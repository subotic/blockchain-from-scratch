//! Before we implement any serious  methods on our client, we must, create the `Block` and `Header`
//! data structures one last time like we did in Chapter 1. the logic you wrote there
//! will be useful here as well and can probably be reused to some extent.
//!
//! Throughout the Blockchain chapter, we created a blockchain data structure that had:
//! 1. a built-in addition accumulator state machine
//! 2. A built-in pow consensus mechanism
//!
//! In the State Machine and Consensus chapters, we designed abstractions over both
//! the state machine and the consensus. We also implemented several examples of each
//! trait.
//!
//! This will be the last time we have to write this blockchain data structure,
//! because this time it will be fully generic over both the state machine and consensus
//! logic, thanks to our traits.
//!
//! This abstraction is the key idea behind blockchain _frameworks_ like Substrate or the Cosmos SDK.
